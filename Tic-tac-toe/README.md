# Renju game

Machine learning project containing combination of supervised and reinforcement learning

In this project I avoid any forbidden moves. So, I have a game of tic-tac-toe

Here is an example of game

In this project I use similar algorithm of learning to AlphaGo Zero.

It is divided by 2 parts.

Firstly, I train a model on dataset of moves made by experts using supervised learning

Then I use MCTS as reinforcement learning to achieve better results

# Playing

To play my game you need to download `Play` folder and run file `play.py`
