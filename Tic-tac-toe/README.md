Machine learning project containing combination of supervised and reinforcement learning

Here is an example of game

In this project I use similar algorithm of learning to AlphaGo Zero.
It is divided by 2 parts.
Firstly, I train a model on dataset of moves made by experts using supervised learning
Then I use reinforcement learning to achieve better results
